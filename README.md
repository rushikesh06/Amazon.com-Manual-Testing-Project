## Project Overview
This repository contains the testing assets for a comprehensive e-commerce platform modeled after Amazon.com. The project focuses on testing essential functionalities like user account management, product catalog, and shopping cart operations. The primary goal of this project is to ensure a seamless, user-friendly experience while maintaining high standards of performance and reliability.

## Key Deliverables
1. **Test Cases**: Detailed test cases covering core functionalities such as user registration, login, product listings, and shopping cart management. The test cases were designed to capture both expected behaviors and potential edge cases.
   
2. **Test Closure Report**: A summary report outlining the testing process, covering the execution of test cases, the identification of defects, and their resolution. It provides insights into the overall quality of the application at the time of test completion.
   
3. **Bug Reports**: Documented issues encountered during the testing phase, categorized by severity and status. Each report includes detailed reproduction steps, expected behavior, and resolution status to assist developers in addressing the defects efficiently.

## Testing Process
The project adopted a structured approach to testing, with emphasis on functional validation, usability assessment, and compatibility checks across various devices and browsers. Key workflows, from user registration to shopping cart operations, were thoroughly tested to ensure robustness.

### Phases of Testing:
- **Test Planning**: Established a clear testing strategy, focusing on the key features of the platform.
- **Test Case Development**: Created exhaustive test cases aimed at covering a wide range of scenarios.
- **Test Execution**: Ran test cases and logged defects in a bug tracking system.
- **Test Closure**: Provided a summary of the overall testing efforts, highlighting the outcomes and quality metrics.

## Tools Used
- **Bug Tracking**: JIRA/Excel was used for managing and tracking the progress of bug resolution.
- **Test Case Management**: Excel was employed to organize, manage, and track test case execution and results.

## Conclusion
This project showcases a complete testing lifecycle for an e-commerce platform(Amazon.com), with the goal of ensuring the platform's core features are reliable and user-friendly. The deliverables in this repository—including test cases, bug reports, and a test closure report—reflect a methodical approach to quality assurance, ensuring the platform is ready for deployment.
